# Details about this project
  Hello internet! This is my first public repository (Hopefully and definitely not the last!) that I've published to GitHub. This project uses the following frameworks:
  - [IGListKit](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit) -> v3.0.0
  - [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya) -> v8.0.5
  - [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) -> v3.1.4
  There's still a lot of stuff that I want to add over time, so keep a look out! 
  
  Stay Awesome!
